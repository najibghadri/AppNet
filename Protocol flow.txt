   (A)  The client requests authorization from the resource owner.  The
        authorization request can be made directly to the resource owner
        (as shown), or preferably indirectly via the authorization
        server as an intermediary.

   (B)  The client receives an authorization grant, which is a
        credential representing the resource owner's authorization,
        expressed using one of four grant types defined in this
        specification or using an extension grant type.  The
        authorization grant type depends on the method used by the
        client to request authorization and the types supported by the
        authorization server.

   (C)  The client requests an access token by authenticating with the
        authorization server and presenting the authorization grant.

   (D)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
        the authorization grant, and if valid, issues an access token.

   (E)  The client requests the protected resource from the resource
        server and authenticates by presenting the access token.

   (F)  The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
        serves the request.
